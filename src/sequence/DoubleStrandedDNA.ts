 * An immutable double-stranded DNA duplex modeled as a pair of complementary {@link DNA}
 * strands.
 *
 * Both strands are stored 5'-to-3' (the conventional reading direction for single-stranded
 * DNA). When laid out as a physical duplex they are antiparallel: the {@link reverse} strand,
 * read 5'-to-3', is the reverse complement of {@link forward} read 5'-to-3'.
 *
 * Instances are immutable. Construction goes through {@link parseDoubleStrandedDNA} (which
 * validates that the supplied pair of strands actually form a duplex) or
 * {@link doubleStrandedDNA} (which synthesizes the reverse strand from a single forward
 * strand). The public constructor accepts an optional sequence-internal key that bypasses
 * validation when the caller can prove the pair is well-formed; the key is module-private and
 * is not part of the package surface.
