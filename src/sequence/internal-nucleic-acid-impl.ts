 *
 * Not re-exported from `src/sequence/index.ts`; only `DNA.ts` and `RNA.ts` extend it. The base
 * is parameterized by an F-bounded `Self` so that Self-returning methods
 * (`getSubsequence`, `getComplement`, `getReverseComplement`) preserve the concrete subclass at
 * call sites, and that Self-accepting methods (`contains`, `equals`, ...) reject the wrong
 * sibling at compile time.

 * construction time and implement {@link NucleicAcidImpl.clone | clone} to build new instances
 * of their own concrete type without re-running validation.
 *
 * The F-bounded `Self` parameter makes every Self-returning method preserve the subclass
 * nominal type, so e.g. `dna.getComplement()` is statically typed as `DNA` and
 * `dna.contains(rna)` fails to type-check.
