/**
 * Branded coordinate types and conversion helpers.
 *
 * The library deals with positions in several distinct coordinate spaces - gene-relative,
 * transcript-relative, and eventually CDS-relative. Mixing them is the single most-common
 * bug source in the codebase. Branded `number` types make the coordinate space part of the
 * type, so the type system prevents accidental cross-space arithmetic at compile time.
 *
 * The brand is purely type-level: at runtime the values are ordinary numbers. Construct via
 * the {@link geneCoord} / {@link transcriptCoord} assignment primitives, and translate between
 * spaces via the conversion helpers.

 * the boundary must walk the relevant `exons: readonly GenomicRegion<TranscriptCoord>[]` list
