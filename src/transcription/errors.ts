 *   `maxPromoterSearchDistance` window upstream of the first exon.
 * - `tss-not-identifiable`: a promoter was located but no TSS coordinate could be derived

 *   TSS falls outside the search-region bounds).
 * - `tss-out-of-bounds`: a forced TSS lies outside the gene sequence.
 * - `tss-conflicts-with-exons`: the detected (or forced) TSS lies downstream of one or more
 *   exon starts, so the transformed exon coordinates would be negative.
