/**
 * Realistic gene sequences for testing that meet biological constraints:
 * - Introns ≥ 20 bp with proper GT...AG splice sites
 * - Exons ≥ 3 bp and ≤ 50,000 bp
 * - Proper start codons (ATG) and biological sequences
 *
 * Each fixture's `splicedRNA` is derived from its `rnaSequence` + `exons` at module load
 * via `buildGeneFixture`, so it cannot drift out of sync if either input is edited.
